        Human rights are part of our invisible identities and everyone's rights deserve to be protected. However, we sometimes even are not aware of when our rights are violated. Since the step before "protecting rights" is "being aware of what rights we have and whether our rights are violated", we decide to make an interactive installation to raise people's awareness. Our intent is to rasie people's awareness that they are wasting human rights in daily life through experiencing an interactive installation and looking through a booklet. We explored how to design the visualization and game mechanism to help people raise self-awareness.

          <h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;">Pre-design Survey</h2>
          <br>
           
           <h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">As the goal of this group is to help students understand their power to waste in life, we selected ten students to conduct interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the current situation of waste and how the students hope to understand waste in this area.
Compared with the questionnaire survey, the questions of the interview are more specific, which makes up for the deficiency of the questionnaire survey to a certain extent.<br></br>

We asked interviewees roughly the following questions:<br>
1. To what extent do you understand consumer rights and copyrights?<br>
2. Do you care about the copyrights of yourself and others in your daily life? How would you deal with such problems? Can you share your opinion?<br>
3. Do you care about your due consumer rights in your daily life? How would you deal with related problems? Can you share your opinion?<br>
4. What method do you think is more appropriate to spread the waste of relevant power to the crowd? Do you have any suggestions and guidance?<br>
5. Do you think that products like ours can help everyone improve their awareness of the use of power and avoid the waste of relevant power to a certain extent?<br></br>

Through the interviews in this group, it is generally understood that the students have a certain understanding of consumer rights and copyrights, but they are not comprehensive. However, in daily life, most students pay more attention to consumer rights and less attention to copyright. When faced with damage to their own interests as consumers, most of the students indicated that they would choose to actively use the powers that consumers should have to resist and curb infringements. Most of the students indicated that they would protect their own and others' copyrights, but most of them did not understand the definition of copyright and related specific matters, and a few students chose to use and maintain copyrights depending on the situation. For question 4, most students think that creative mini-games and brochures are a better way to popularize related waste, and give suggestions on product details. One of the students gave detailed suggestions and strong support for the production of the game, and gave some help to the deployment of related game equipment. At the end of the interview, all interviewees agreed that the waste of power is very common and is closely related to our lives. It can help people reduce waste, can have a positive effect and influence, and has certain value and significance.<br></br>

           <h2 style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif; font-weight: lighter">Interactive games have a high degree of participation, are simple and easy to use, do not require players’ other equipment, are highly interesting, and are suitable for spreading knowledge about consumer rights and interests. After a certain evaluation, it is found that the user's response is good, and it does have the effect of popularizing and education. <br></br>Some users pointed out that the game we designed cannot actually solve the problem: although the manual lists a lot of knowledge about consumer rights, users only need to remember the icons during the game, and do not need to read the text and related information in the manual. Therefore, We tried to use both <b>booklet</b> and <b>interactive games</b>.
